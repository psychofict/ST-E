Self-Training for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation"

II. Project Introduction
Objective:
This project focuses on developing a semi-supervised approach for semantic segmentation using self-training. The aim is to leverage unlabeled data to improve the segmentation performance of models trained with limited labeled data, an increasingly relevant issue in real-world applications where manual labeling is costly and time-consuming. Self-training can help exploit large datasets while reducing human annotation costs.

Motivation:
In semantic segmentation, obtaining a sufficient amount of labeled data is often a bottleneck, especially in fields like medical imaging and autonomous driving. Semi-supervised learning offers a solution by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. The key motivation behind this project is to refine self-training methodologies by addressing confirmation biasâ€”a common problem where the model increasingly reinforces its own incorrect predictions during training on pseudo-labeled data. By implementing more efficient strategies to mitigate this bias, the project aims to improve both accuracy and generalization in segmentation tasks.
